Created with the zky programming language in BrightEditor, both written by me.

Compiled with zkyCompiler, also written by me and integrated into my IDE.

I'm still developing the zky programming language and zkyCompiler, so yea only I'm able to compile this program as of me writing this now.

But the compiled exe is in zkyRelease folder, and is 178 KB.
